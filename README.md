# LeetCode_Problems

## This project contains some of the LeetCode problem's code solution in JAVA. I am adding more solutions to the list day by day.

### I have also categorized them in various topics which are main Algorithmic Paradigms in Computer Science.

### Apart from just solving the problem, the code follows Coding Best Practices, with appropriate indentation and Naming Conventions. The comments for few codes have been added, but I will add comments to the remaining eventually.

### Each solution also contains some sample test cases using a Driver function.
